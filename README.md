### Building

Make sure you have an Android emulator setup if you want to run the android client. Also make sure you have GTK installed if you want to run that.

Otherwise, a simple build and run should suffice. You may run into client certificate issues with android, read up on it here: https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/android-certificates/
